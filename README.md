A free-to-win rhythm game. Rhythm is just a _click_ away!

The future of [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) and the beginning of an open era! Currently known by and released under the release codename "*lazer*". As in sharper than cutting-edge.

## Status
This project is under heavy development, but is in a stable state. Users are encouraged to try it out and keep it installed alongside the stable *osu!* client. It will continue to evolve to the point of eventually replacing the existing stable client as an update.

Please also note that game resources are covered by a separate licence. Please see the [ppy/osu-resources](https://github.com/ppy/osu-resources) repository for clarifications.
